# udacity-projects
This repository holds a collection of project files for my Udacity courses.

# Requirements

All of the projects currently in this repository are part of the Become a Data Science nanodegree.

Most of these projects are completed in a Jupyter Notebook using python and several python modules such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, pytorch and many more. For detailed information on which modules are used check the the import statements at the top of the notebooks.

# Project Outline

I'll give a brief description of all the projects in this repository. For more details feel free to check the code or notebooks, I usually try to explain what I'm doing as comments in the code and notebook.

## Project 1

## Project 2

## Project 3: CRISP-DM & BLOGPOST

Based on the yearly stackoverflow survey I analyze various regional differences and how they develop over time. The datasets can be found here: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey. They are also included in the directory of this project.

For the analysis I follow the CRISP-DM process. Starting by developing a business and data understanding about the surveys, which I was previously unfmailiar with. Then, preparing the data for the analysis. And finally the analysis itself. For the analysis I provided various methods and procedures that I could use repeatedly to analyse and visualize the data. During this process I often had to iterate and go back to the data preparation tasks and even to the data understanding. Thus, this last part encompasses the Modelling, Evaluation and Deployment of the CRISP-DM.

The results were published in form of a blogpost on Medium.


# License

Well, this repository is mostly used for the submission of these projects. The general outline of the projects (often icl. the layout of the jupyter notebook) usually comes from udacity. Much of the code is written by myself and you can use it in whatever way pleases you. If you are doing the same or similar course and use these project files for help, please make sure you follow the Udacity guidelines on using someone else's code.
