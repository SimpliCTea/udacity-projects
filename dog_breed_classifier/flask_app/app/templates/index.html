                I'm your friendly neighbourhood dog breed classifier. Do you have a picture of a dog and want to know what breed 
                it is? Let me take a look, maybe I can help you.

            How To:
        </h2>
        <p class="">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    You can select an image of a dog to be classified by dragging it onto the grey default image below. 
                    Alternatively you can use the File Input field below, that way I'll open up a file browser for you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once an image has been selected or dropped I'll display on the left side.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the right side you can see a button with "Classify". Using this button you ask me to name you 
                    the corresponding dog breed. The image will be uploaded to the server for this purpose, but don't worry,
                    the image will be deleted after the algorithm is done with it, so no personal data is saved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I'll display the results below the "Classify" Button. Enjoy!
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh btw. if you want to have some fun you can try this with an image of a person. I'll try to predict
            the dog breed the person resembles the most. Just make sure the face of the person is clearly visible.
